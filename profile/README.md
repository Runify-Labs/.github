# Runify

## Push your running pace with the power of music

This app helps you easily create playlists at a desired BPM to match your cadence. Playlists can be created by selecting the desired BPM and then selecting songs or artists to use as _seeds_ for the playlist. Runify uses Spotify's tremendous recommendation algorithm to create a playlist that can be added to your library with the click of a button.

## Usage

Login, select your desired BPM, songs/artists to use as seeds and generate a playlist!
